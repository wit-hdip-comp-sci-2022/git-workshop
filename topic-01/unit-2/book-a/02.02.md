# What is Git?

* The most widely used version control system in the world. 
* It's open source, originall developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds. 
* Has a distributed architecture. Rather than a single history, every users repository stores the history of the software. 
* Built for performance
* Secured by a cryptographically secure hashing algorithm called SHA256
* Git is the de facto standard 
* Unfortunately, Git is hard (ಥ﹏ಥ)
