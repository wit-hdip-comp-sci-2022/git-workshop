# Practical Stashing

Create new changes, the branch here doesnt matter. 
```sh
git echo 'I am a new change' >> hello.txt
```

Now view the status of your branch
```sh
$ git status
```

Stash those changes
```sh
$ git stash save "Experimental work with hello.txt"
```

View the status again
```sh
$ git status
```

Lets view your stashes
```sh
$ git stash list
```

Now to bring your changes back to your branch, you can apply them from the stash, by running the following
```sh
$ git stash apply stash@{0}
```

View the status once more to see your re-applied changes.
```sh
$ git status
```

View your stashes and notice your changes are still stored in the stash
```sh
$ git stash list
```

To remove them you need to use the drop command
```sh
$ git stash drop stash@{0}
```

Ensure they are removed
```sh
$ git stash list
```

If the change you want is on top of the stash, or at location 0, you can apply and drop the stash in one go using the pop command
```sh
$ git stash pop
```
