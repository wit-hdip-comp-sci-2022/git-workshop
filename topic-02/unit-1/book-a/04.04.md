# Practical Commits

Lets start by creating a project and working directory. 

```sh
$ <mkdir/dir> git-workshop
$ cd git-workshop
```

Lets list all the files in the directory
```sh
$ ls -a
```

Now we want to initialise our repo
```sh
$ git init
```

Finally list the files again 
```sh
$ ls -a
```

Awesome, now we have created our directory and initialised our repo we can start creating commits, and begin our history in the repo. 

First lets create a new file
```sh
$ echo 'Hello, World!' > hello.txt
```

To add that file to `staging`
```sh
$ git add hello.txt
```

Now create the commit
```sh
$ git commit -m "adding hello.txt"
```

Lets rinse and repeat that cycle, first lets change the file content
```sh
$ echo 'my name is <your_name>!' >> hello.txt
```

Now to add and commit our changes 
```sh
$ git add hello.txt
# lets check the status
$ git status
$ git commit -m "added my name to hello file"
```
