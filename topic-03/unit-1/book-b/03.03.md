# Interactive Rebasing

* Interactive rebasing gives you the opportunity to alter commit 
* More powerful then automated rebasing as it offers complete control over the branch’s commit history
* Normally used to clean up a messy commit history

Some actions we can perform interactively:

* Pick - Use Commit
* Reword - Use Commit but edit the commit message
* Edit - Use commit, but stop for amending
* Drop - remove commit
* Squash - Use commit, but meld into previous commit
* Fixup - like “squash” but discard the commit log message
* Exec - run command using shell
* Break - stop here
* Label - label current HEAD with a name
* Reset - reset HEAD to a label
