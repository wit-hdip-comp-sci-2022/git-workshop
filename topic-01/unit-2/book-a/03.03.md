# Some house keeping

Here we will ensure your Git is installed and validate that and set if needed your git config. 

We are going to assume you have Git installed, if not just shout and we will assist you in setting up on your machine. Otherwise lets make sure some basic config is in place before starting 

First we want get your user name 
```
$ git config --get user.name
```
If you do not get a user name as a response lets set your username 
```
# if you have a github user name, its a good idea to set the same name here, also remember to keep it somewhat professional.
$ git config --global user.name "my_name"
```

Now we need to get or set your user email address 
```
$ git config --get user.email
```
Same as above if you do not get your email as a response lest set your email.
```
# same as above, its a good idea to set this email as the same email associated with your github profile, oh and keep it somewhat professional too. 
$ git config --global user.email "my_email@badCoffee.com
```
