# Practical Interactive Rebase

Make sure you are starting on the right this time
```sh
$ git checkout right
```

Check the log
```sh
$ git log
```

Notice two commit messages 
```
987a54f right is the best
d0b7cb6 left is the best
```

Lets `squash` those commits into one
```sh
$ git rebase -i HEAD~2
```

Update the commit operations in the text editor
```
reword XXXXXXX right is the best
fixup XXXXXXX left is the best
```

* Now save that file, to give the re-word option
* Read the output, and update the new commit message
* Save the file

Finally check the log
```sh
$ git log
```
