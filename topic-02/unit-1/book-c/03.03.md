# Practical Fast-Forward Merging

Start by checking out master 
```sh
$ git checkout master
```

Have a quick look at the logs
```sh
$ git log
```

Now lets merge in our `favourite-animal` branch to master
```sh
$ git merge favourite-animal
```

Checking the logs again to see what changed
```sh
$ git log
```

Its safe now to delete our `favourite-animal` branch
```sh
$ git branch -d favourite-animal
```
