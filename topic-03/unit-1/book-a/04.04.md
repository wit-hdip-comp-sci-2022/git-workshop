Sometimes we can not instantly resolve a conflict, Git allows us to abort a merge to bring our environment back to its original state before attempting the merge. 

To abort a merge, simply run the following
```sh
$ git merge --abort
```

To minimise merge conflicts keep commits small and integrate changes often.
