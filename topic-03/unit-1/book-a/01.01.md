# What is a Conflict?

* Conflicts occur when trying to integrate (merge) changes from two different states
* When these states both have changes to the same part of the same file


When a conflict happens, Git can not figure out which version to use so the following happens:
* Git stops the merge before the merge commit
* Requires user intervention to resolve the conflict
