# What is Version Control?

Version Control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code. 

* Think of apps on your phone, or games needing updates
* It enables software engineers to manage changes over time, through a version control system (vcs)
* Changes are stored in a special kind of database, tracking all modifications, keeping a history.
* Provide protection to code bases, and gives the ability to turn back time. 
* Allows multiple people to work on the same project in parallel. 

*Bonus Information* Semantic Versioning (semver) - Major.Minor.Patch
