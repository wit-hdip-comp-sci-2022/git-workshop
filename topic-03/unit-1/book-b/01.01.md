# What is Rebasing?

* An alternative to merging
* Moves the entire feature branch to the tip of the master branch
* But without using a merge commit, rebasing re-writes the project history. By creating a new commit for each commit in the original branch
* Major benefit of rebasing is you get a much cleaner project history, and second to this, you end up with a prefectly linear project.
