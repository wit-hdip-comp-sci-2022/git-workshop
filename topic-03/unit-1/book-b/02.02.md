# Practical Rebase

As always, make sure you are on master
```sh
$ git checkout master
```

Create a new file to master branch
```sh
$ echo "rebasing is fun" > rebase.txt
```

Add the new file changes
```sh
$ git add rebase.txt
```

Commit this new file
```sh
$ git commit -m 'adding rebase text file'
```

Now lets checkout the right branch
```sh
$ git checkout right
```

Check the status and also lets make note of the contents of the directory
```sh
$ git status
$ ls -l
```

Now check the git log and make note of what you see
```sh
$ git log
```

Lets rebase the right branch with the master branch
```sh
$ git rebase master
```

Oh no a conflict, why?
```
(☞ຈل͜ຈ)☞ Hint read the output
```

Open conflict.txt and fix the conflict same as before.

Add the fixed file
```sh
$ git add conflict.txt
```

Continue Rebase
```sh
$ git rebase --continue
```

Now lets check the log
```sh
$ git log
```
